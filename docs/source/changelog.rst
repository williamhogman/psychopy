Changelog
====================


.. raw:: html

    <style> .red {color:red} </style>

.. role:: red

.. note::
  Version numbers

  In general, when a new feature is added the second number is incremented (e.g. 1.00.05 -> 1.01.00). Those releases might break previous code you've written because new features often need slight changes to other things.
  Changes to the final digit (1.00.05 -> 1.00.06) indicate a bug-fixing release or very minor new features that shouldn't require code changes from the user.

:red:`Changes in red typically indicate things that alter the PsychoPy behaviour in a way that could could break compatibility. Be especially wary of those!`

PsychoPy 1.74
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.74.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy)

* ADDED: 'enable escape' option in experiment settings, default is enabled
* CHANGED: remove python 2.4's version of sha1 digest from info.py (RunTimeInfo); StandAlone versions do not use python 2.4

PsychoPy 1.73
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.73.05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy)

* FIXED: Joystick error when calling :class:`~psychopy.hardware.joystick.Joystick.getHat()` or :class:`~psychopy.hardware.joystick.Joystick.getHats()` (fixed by Gary Lupyan)
* FIXED: BufferImageStim crashing on some linux boxes (due to bug with checking version of OpenGL) (fixed by Jonas Lindelov)
* FIXED: fMRI emulator class was providing old-format key events (fixed by Erik Kastman and Jeremy)
* FIXED: Win.setRecordFrameIntervals(True) was including the time since it was turned off as a frame interval (fixed by Alex Holcombe)
* FIXED: using forceEndtrial from a mouse component in Builder wasn't working (thanks Esteban for the heads-up)
* FIXED: visual.Circle now respects the edges parameter (fixed by Jonas Lindelov)
* FIXED: having IPython v0.12 should no longer crash psychopy on startup (Jeremy)
* FIXED: non-ascii month-name (eg Japanese) from %B is now filtered out to avoid crash when compile a psyexp script (Jeremy)

* ADDED: option to vertically flip a BufferImageStim upon capture (esp for fMRI-related presentation of text) (Jeremy)
* ADDED: option to play a sound (simple tone) during fMRI launchScan simulation (Jeremy)

PsychoPy 1.73.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Feb 2012)

* :red:`CHANGED: Builder scripts now silently convert division from integers to float where necessary.` That means 1/3=0.333 whereas previously 1/3=0. This is done simply by adding the line `from __future__ import division` at the top of the script, which people using Coder might want to think about too.
* FIXED: problem with loading .psydat files using misc.fromFile (thanks Becky)
* FIXED: issue on OSX with updating from 1.70 binaries to 1.73 patch release

PsychoPy 1.73.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Jan 2012)

* FIXED: problem with loops crashing during save of xlsx/csv files if conditions were empty
* FIXED: bugs in Builder setting Dots coherence and direction parameters
* FIXED: problem with strange text and image rendering on some combinations of ATI graphics on Windows machines

PsychoPy 1.73.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Jan 2012)

* ADDED: loop property to :class:`~psychopy.visual.MovieStim` for coder only so far (thanks Ariel Rokem)
* FIXED: buglet requesting import of pyaudio (thanks Britt for noticing and Dan Shub for fixing)
* FIXED: problem with avbin (win32)
* FIXED: problem with unicode characters in filenames preventing startup
* FIXED: bug with 'fullRandom' method of :class:`~psychopy.data.TrialHandler` missing some trials during data save
* FIXED: :func:`Mouse.clickReset()` now resets the click timers
* FIXED(?): problem with avbin.dll not being found under 64-bit windows

PsychoPy 1.73.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Jan 2012)

* :red:`CHANGED: psychopy.log has moved to psychopy.logging (Alex Holcombe's suggestion). You'll now get a deprecation warning for using psychopy.log but it will still work (for the foreseeable future)`
* ADDED: new hardware.joystick module supporting pyglet and pyjame backbends for windows and OSX. Demo in Not working on Linux yet. See demos>input
* ADDED: support for CRS ColorCAL mkII for gamma calibrations in Monitor Center.
* ADDED: data.ExpHandler to combine data for multiple separate loops in one study, including output of a single wide csv file. See demos>experimental control>experimentHandler. Support from Builder should now be easy to add
* ADDED: ability to fix (seed) the pseudorandom order of trials in Builder random/full-random loops
* ADDED: auto-update (and usage stats) can now detect proxies in proxy.pac files. Also this now runs in a low-priority background thread to prevent any slowing at startup time.
* FIXED: bug when passing variables to Staircase loops in Builder
* FIXED: mouse in Builder now ignores button presses that began before the 'start' of the mouse
* FIXED: can now use pygame or pyaudio instead of pygame for sounds, although it still isn't recommended (thanks Ariel Rokem for patch)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(rc1 released Nov 2011)

* :red:`CHANGED: gui.Dlg and gui.dlgFromDict can now take a set of choices and will convert to a choice control if this is used (thanks Manuel Ebert)`
    - for gui.Dlg the `.addField()` method now has `choices` attribute
    - for gui.dlgFromDict if one of the values in the dict is a list it will be interpreted as a set of choices (NB this potentially breaks old code)
    - for info see API docs for psychopy.gui

* ADDED: improvements to drawing of shapes (thanks Manuel Ebert for all)
    - ShapeStim now has a size parameter that scales the locations of vertices
    - new classes; Rect, Line, Circle, Polygon

* FIXED: error with DotStim when fieldSize was a tuple and fieldShape was 'sqr' 
* FIXED: calibration plots in Monitor Center now resize and quit as expected
* FIXED: conditions files can now have lists of numbers [0,0]
* FIXED: buglet with flushing mouse events (thanks Sebastiaan Mathot)
* FIXED: Builder components now draw in order, from top to bottom, so lower items obscure higher ones
* FIXED: problem with Patch Component when size was set to be dynamic
* FIXED: problem with Builder loops not being able to change type (e.g. change 'random' into 'staircase')
* FIXED: data from TrialHandler can be output with unicode contents (thanks Henrik Singmann)


PsychoPy 1.71
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.71.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Oct 2011)

* CHANGED: the number of stimulus-resized and frames-dropped warnings is now limited to 5 (could become a preference setting?)
* FIXED: Builder now allows images to have size of None (or 'none' or just blank) and reverts to using the native size of the image in the file
* FIXED: occasional glitch with rendering caused by recent removal of depth testing (it was getting turned back on by TextStim.draw())
* FIXED: opening a builder file from coder window (and vice versa) switches view and opens there
* FIXED: problem showing the About... item on OS X Builder view
* FIXED problem with loops not showing up if the conditions file wasn't found
* FIXED: runTimeInfo: better handling of cwd and git-related info
* FIXED: rating scale: single click with multiple rating scales, auto-scale with precision = 1
* IMPROVED: rendering speed on slightly older nVidia cards (e.g. GeForce 6000/7000 series) under win32/linux. ElementArrays now render at full speed. Other cards/systems should be unchanged.
* IMPROVED: rating scale: better handling of default description, scale=None more intuitive
* ADDED: new function getFutureTrial(n=1) to TrialHandler, allowing users to find out what a trial will be without actually going to that trial
* ADDED: misc.createXYs() to help creating a regular grid of xy values for ElementArrayStim

PsychoPy 1.71.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released Sept 2011)

* :red:`CHANGED: Depth testing is now disabled. It was already being recommended that depth was controlled purely by drawing order (not depth settings) but this is now the *only* way to do that`
* CHANGED: The Builder representation of the Components onset/offset is now based on 'estimatedStart/Stop' where a value has been given. NB this does not affect the actual onset/offset of Components merely its representation on the timeline.
* ADDED: Builder loop conditions mini-editor: (right-click in the filename box in a loop dialog)
    - create, edit, and save conditions from within PsychoPy; save & load using pickle format
    - preview .csv or .xlsx conditions files (read-only)
* ADDED: RatingScale method to allow user to setMarkerPosition()
* ADDED: Builder dialogs display a '$' to indicate fields that expect code/numeric input
* ADDED: Text Component now has a wrapWidth parameter to control the bounding box of the text
* ADDED: Opacity parameter to visual stimulus components in the Builder, so you can now draw plaids etc from the builder
* FIXED: can edit or delete filename from loop dialog
* FIXED: bug in RunTimeInfo (no longer assumes that the user has git installed)
* FIXED: bug in BufferImageStim
* FIXED: bug in Builder Ratingscale (was always ending routine on response)
* FIXED: problem with nested loops in Builder. Inner loop was not being repeated. Loops are now only created as they are needed in the code, not at the beginning of the script
* FIXED: rendering of many stimuli was not working beyond 1000 elements (fixed by removal of depth testing)
* FIXED: mouse component now using start/duration correctly (broken since 1.70.00)
* FIXED: when changing the texture (image) of a PatchStim, the stimulus now 'remembers' if it had been created with no size/sf set and updates these for the new image (previously the size/sf got set according to the first texture provided)
* FIXED: putting a number into Builder Sound Component does now produce a sound of that frequency
* FIXED: added 'sound','misc','log' to the component names that PsychoPy will refuse. Also a slightly more informative warning when the name is already taken
* FIXED: Opacity parameter was having no effect on TextStim when using shaders
* FIXED bug with MovieStim not starting at beginning of movie unless a new movie was added each routine


PsychoPy 1.70
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.70.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* FIXED: bug in Builder Ratingscale (was always ending routine on response)
* FIXED: problem with nested loops in Builder. Inner loop was not being repeated. Loops are now only created as they are needed in the code, not at the beginning of the script
* FIXED: rendering of many stimuli was not working beyond 1000 stimuli (now limit is 1,000,000)
* FIXED: mouse component now using start/duration correctly (broken since 1.70.00)
* FIXED: when changing the texture (image) of a PatchStim, the stimulus now 'remembers' if it had been created with no size/sf set and updates these for the new image (previously the size/sf got set according to the first texture provided)
* CHANGED: Depth testing is now disabled. It was already being recommended that depth was controlled purely by drawing order (not depth settings) but this is now the *only* way to do that
* CHANGED: The Builder representation of the Components onset/offset is now based on 'estimatedStart/Stop' where a value has been given. NB this does not affect the actual onset/offset of Components merely its representation on the timeline.

PsychoPy 1.70.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released Aug 2011)

* FIXED: buglet with Builder (1.70.00) importing older files not quite right and corrupting the 'allowedKeys' of keyboard component
* FIXED: buglet with SimpleImageStim. On machines with no shaders some images were being presented strangely
* FIXED: buglet with PatchStim. After a call to setSize, SF was scaling with the stimulus (for unit types where that shouldn't happen)

PsychoPy 1.70.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released Aug 2011)

*NB This version introduces a number of changes to Builder experiment files that will prevent files from this version being opened by earlier versions of PsychoPy*

* :red:`CHANGED use of allowedKeys in Keyboard Component.` You used to be able to type `ynq` to get those keys, but this was confusing when you then needed `'space'` or `'left'` etc. Now you must type 'y','n','q', which makes it more obvious how to include 'space','left','right'...
* CHANGED dot algorithm in DotStim. Previously the signalDots=same/different was using the opposite to Scase et al's terminology, now they match. Also the default method for noiseDots was 'position' and this has been changed to 'direction'. The documentation explaining the algorithms has been clarified. (see :ref:`dots`)
* CHANGED `MovieStim.playing` property to be called `MovisStim.status` (in keeping with other stimuli)
* CHANGED names:

    - `data.importTrialTypes` is now `data.importConditions`
    - `forceEndTrial` in Keyboard Component is now `forceEndRoutine`
    - `forceEndTrialOnPress` in Mouse Component is now `forceEndRoutineOnPress`
    - `trialList` and `trialListFile` in Builder are now `conditions` and `conditionsFile`, respectively
    - 'window units' to set Component units is now 'from exp settings' for less confusion

* :red:`CHANGED numpy imports in Builder scripts:`

    - only a subset of numpy features are now imported by default: numpy: sin, cos, tan, log, log10, pi, average, sqrt, std, deg2rad, rad2deg, linspace, asarray, random, randint, normal, shuffle
    - all items in the numpy namespace are available as np.*
    - if a pre-v1.70 script breaks due to this change, try prepending 'np.' or 'np.random.'

* :red:`CHANGED: Builder use of $.` $ can now appear anywhere in the field (previously only the start). To display a '$' character now requires '\\$' in a text field (to prevent interpretation of normal text as being code).

* ADDED flexibility for start/stop in Builder Components. Can now specify stimuli according to;

    - variable values (using $ symbol). You can also specify an 'expected' time/duration so that something is still drawn on the timeline
    - number of frames, rather than time (s), for greater precision
    - an arbitrary condition (e.g. otherStim.status==STOPPED )

* ADDED the option to use a raised cosine as a PatchStim mask (thanks Ariel Rokem)
* ADDED a preference setting for adding custom path locations to Standalone PsychoPy
* ADDED Dots Component to Builder interface for random dot kinematograms
* ADDED wide-format data files (saveAsWideText()) (thanks Michael MacAskill)
* ADDED option for full randomization of repeated lists (loop type 'fullRandom') (Jeremy)
* ADDED builder icons can now be small or large (in prefs)
* ADDED checking of conditions files for parameter name conflicts (thanks Jeremy)
* ADDED emulate sync pulses and user key presses for fMRI or other scanners (for testing); see hardware/launchScan in the API reference, and Coder `demos > experimental control > fMRI_launchScan.py` (Jeremy)
* ADDED right-clicking the expInfo in Experiment Settings tests & previews the dialog box (Jeremy)
* ADDED syntax checking in code component dialog, right-click (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED documentation (thanks Becky Sharman)
* IMPROVED syntax for using $ in code snippets (e.g., "[$xPos, $yPos]" works) (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED Flow and Routine displays in the Builder, with zooming; see the View menu for key-board shortcuts (Jeremy)
* IMPROVED Neater (and slightly faster) changing of Builder Routines on file open/close
* FIXED demos now unpack to an empty folder (Jeremy)
* FIXED deleting an empty loop from the flow now works (Jeremy)
* FIXED further issue in QUEST (the addition in 1.65.01 was being used too widely)
* FIXED bug with updating of gamma grid values in Monitor Center

PsychoPy 1.65
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.65.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released July 2011

* FIXED Builder keyboard component was storing 'all keys' on request but not all RTs
* FIXED Aperture Component in Builder, which was on for an entire Routine. Now supports start/stop times like other components
* IMPROVED Sound stimuli in Builder:

    * FIXED: sounds could be distorted and would repeat if duration was longer than file
    * ADDED volume parameter to sound stimuli
    * FIXED: duration parameter now stops a file half-way through if needed

* FIXED buglet preventing some warning messages being printed to screen in Builder experiments

PsychoPy 1.65.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Released July 2011)

* ADDED improved gamma correction using L=a+(b+kI)**G formula (in addition to industry-standard form). Existing gamma calibrations will continue to use old equation but new calibrations will take the new extended formula by default.
* ADDED MultiStairHandler to run multiple interleaved staircases (also from the Builder)
* ADDED createFactorialTrialList, a convenience function for full factorial conditions (thanks Marco Bertamini)
* CHANGED Builder keyboard components now have the option to discard previous keys (on by default)
* CHANGED RatingScale:

  - ADDED: argument to set lineColor independently (thanks Jeff Bye)
  - CHANGED default marker is triangle (affects windows only)
  - ADDED single-click option, custom-marker support
  - FIXED: bug with precision=1 plus auto-rescaling going in steps of 10 (not 1)

* FIXED errors with importing from 'ext' and 'contrib'
* FIXED error in joystick demos
* FIXED bug in ElementArrayStim depth
* FIXED bug in misc.maskMatrix. Was not using correct scale (0:1) for the mask stage
* FIXED buglet in StairHandler, which was only terminating during a reversal
* FIXED bug when loading movies - they should implicitly pause until first draw() (thanks Giovanni Ottoboni)
* IMPROVED handling of non-responses in Builder experiments, and this can now be the correct answer too (corrAns=None). ie. can now do go/no-go experiments. (Non-responses are now empty cells in excel file, not "--" as before.)

PsychoPy 1.64
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.64.00

    - FIXED bug in RatingScale that prevented scale starting at zero
    - ADDED RatingScale "choices" (non-numeric); text size, color, font, & anchor labels; pos=(x,y) (Jeremy Gray)
    - CHANGED RatingScale internals; renamed escapeKeys as skipKeys; subject now uses 'tab' to skip (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED user-configurable code/output font (see coder prefs to change)

    - pyxid (Cedrus button boxes)
    - labjack (good, fast, cheap USB I/O device)
    - egi (pynetstation)
    - pylink (SR Research eye trackers)
    - psignifit (bootstrapping, but only added on mac for now)

* FIXED bug in windows prefs that prevents v1.63.03 from starting up
* FIXED bug that prevents minolte LS100 from being found

PsychoPy 1.63.03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Feb 2011

* ADDED Interactive shell to the bottom panel of the Coder view. Choose (in prefs) one of;
    * pyShell (the default, with great tooltips and help)
    * IPython (for people that like it, but beware it crashes if you create a psychopy.visual.Window() due to some threading issue(?))
* ADDED scrollbar to output panel
* FIXED small bug in QUEST which gave an incorrectly-scaled value for the next() trial
* FIXED ElementArrayStim was not drawing correctly to second window in multi-display setups
* FIXED negative sound durations coming from Builder, where sound was starting later than t=0
* FIXED a problem where Builder experiments failed to run if 'participant' wasn't in the experiment info dialog

PsychoPy 1.63.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Feb 2011

* ADDED clearFrames option to Window.saveMovieFrames
* ADDED support for Spectrascan PR655/PR670
* ADDED 'height' as a type of unit for visual stimuli
    NB. this is likely to become the default unit for new users (set in prefs)
    but for existing users the unit set in their prefs will remain. That means
    that your system may behave differently to your (new user) colleague's
* IMPROVED handling of damaged experiments in Builder (they don't crash the app any more!)
* IMPROVED performance of autoLogging (including demos showing how to turn of autoLog for dynamic stimuli)

PsychoPy 1.63.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Jan 2011

* FIXED bug with ElementArrayStim.setFieldPos() not updating
* FIXED mouse release problem with pyglet (since in 1.63.00)
* ADDED ability to retrieve a timestamp for a mouse event, similar to those in keyboard events.

    for a frame flip). Thanks Dave Britton
* FIXED bug with filters.makeGrating: gratType='sqr' was not using ori and phase
* FIXED bug with fetching version info for autoupdate (was sometimes causing a crash on startup
    if users selected 'skip ths version')
* CHANGED optimisation routine from fmin_powell to fmin_bfgs. It seems more robust to starting params.

PsychoPy 1.63.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Dec 2010

* **ADDED autoLog mechanism:**
    * many more messages sent, but only written when log.flush() is called
    * rewritten backend to logging functions to remove file-writing performance hit
    * added `autoLog` and `name` attributes to visual stimuli
    * added setAutoDraw() method to visual stimuli (draws on every win.flip() until set to False)
    * added logNextFlip() method to visual.Window to send a log message time-stamped to flip
* **FIXED bug in color calibration for LMS color space (anyone using this space should recalibrate immediately)** Thanks Christian Garber for picking up on this one.
* FIXED bug with excel output from StairHandler
* FIXED bug in ElemetArray.setSizes()
* FIXED bug in running QuestHandler (Zarrar Shehzad)
* FIXED bug trying to remove a Routine from Flow when enclosed in a Loop

    * numpy=1.5.1, scipy=0.8.0, matplotlib=1.0
* UPDATED: Builder demos

PsychoPy 1.62
------------------------------

PsychoPy 1.62.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Oct 2010

* FIXED: problem with RadialStim causing subsequent TextStims not to be visible
* FIXED: bug with saving StairHandler data as .xlsx
* ADDED: option for gui.fileOpenDlg and fileSaveDlg to receive a custom file filter
* FIXED: builder implementation of staircases (initialisation was buggy)
* FIXED: added Sound.setSound() so that sounds in builder can take new values each trial
* FIXED: when a Routine was copied and pasted it didn't update its name properly (e.g. when inserted into the Flow it kept the origin name)
* FIXED: color rendering for stimuli on non-shader machines using dkl,lms, and named color spaces
* ADDED: data.QuestHandler (Thanks to Zarrar Shehzad). This is much like StairHandler but uses the QUEST routine of Watson and Pelli
* **CHANGED: TextStim orientation now goes the other way, for consistency with other stimuli (thanks Manuel Spitschan for noticing)**
* FIXED: Problem with DotStim using 'sqr' fieldShape
* ADDED: MovieStim now has a setMovie() method (a copy of loadMovie())
* FIXED: problem with MovieStim.loadMovie() when a movie had already been loaded

PsychoPy 1.62.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Sept 2010

* ADDED: clicking on a Routine in the Flow window brings that Routine to current focus above
* ADDED: by setting a loop in the Flow to have 0 repeats, that part of your experiment can be skipped
* CHANGED: builder hides mouse now during fullscreen experiments (should make this a pref or setting though?)
* FIXED: rendering problem with the Flow and Routine panels not updating on some platforms
* ADDED: added .pause() .play() and .seek() to MovieStim (calling .draw() while paused will draw current static frame)
* FIXED: bug in MovieStim.setOpacity() (Ariel Rokem)
* FIXED: bug in win32 - shortcuts were created in user-specific start menu not all-users start menu
* CHANGED: data output now uses std with N-1 normalisation rather than (scipy default) N
* FIXED: bug when .psyexp files were dropped on Builder frame
* FIXED: bug with Builder only storing last letter or multi-key button (e.g. 'left'->'t') under certain conditions
* FIXED: when nReps=0 in Builder the loop should be skipped (was raising error)
* CHANGED: mouse icon is now hidden for full-screen Builder experiments
* FIXED: Builder was forgetting the TrialList file if you edited something else in the loop dialog
* ADDED: visual.RatingScale and a demo to show how to use it (Jeremy Gray)
* ADDED: The Standalone distributions now includes the following external libs:
    - pynetstation (import psychopy.hardware.egi)
    - ioLab library (import psychopy.harware.ioLab)
* ADDED: trial loops in builder can now be aborted by setting someLoopName.finished=True
* ADDED: improved timing. *Support for blocking on VBL for all platforms* (may still not work on intel integrated chips)
* FIXED: minor bug with closing Coder windows generating spurious error messages
* ADDED: 'allowed' parameter to gui.fileOpeNDlg and fileCloseDlg to provide custom file filters

PsychoPy 1.62.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: August 2010

* ADDED: support for Excel 2007 files (.xlsx) for data output and trial types input:
    - psychopy.data now has importTrialList(fileName) to generate a trial list (suitable for TrialHandler) from .xlsx or .csv files
    - Builder loops now accept either an xlsx or csv file for the TrialList
    - TrialHandler and StairHandler now have saveToExcel(filename, sheetName='rawData', appendFile=True). This can be used to generate almost identical files to the previous delimited files, but also allows multiple (named) worksheets in a single file. So you could have one file for a participant and then one sheet for each session or run.
* CHANGED: for builder experiments the trial list for a loop is now imported from the file on every run, rather than just when the file is initially chosen
* CHANGED: data for TrialHandler are now stored as masked arrays where possible. This means that trials with no response can be more easily ignored by analysis
* FIXED: bug opening loop properties (bug introduced by new advanced params option)
* FIXED: bug in Builder code generation for keyboard (only when using forceEnd=True but store='nothing')
* CHANGED: RunTimeInfo is now in psychopy.info not psychopy.data
* CHANGED: PatchStim for image files now defaults to showing the image at native size in pixels (making SimpleImageStim is less useful?)
* CHANGED: access to the parameters of TrialList in the Builder now (by default) uses a more cluttered namespace for variables. e.g. if your TrialList file has heading rgb, then your components can access that with '$rgb' rather than '$thisTrial.rgb'. This behaviour can be turned off with the new Builder preference 'allowClutteredNamespace'.
* FIXED: if Builder needs to output info but user had closed the output window, it is now reopened
* FIXED: Builder remembers its window location
* CHANGED: Builder demos now need to be fetched by the user - menu item opens a browser (this is slightly more effort, but means the demos aren't stored within the app which is good)
* CHANGED: loops/routines now get inserted to Flow by clicking the mouse where you want them :-)
* ADDED: you can now have multiple Builder windwos open with different experiments
* ADDED: you can now copy and paste Routines form one Builder window to another (or itself) - useful for reusing 'template' routines
* FIXED: color of window was incorrectly scaled for 'named' and 'rgb256' color spaces
* ADDED: quicktime movie output for OSX 10.6 (10.5 support was already working)
* ADDED: Mac app can now receive dropped files on the coder and builder panels (but won't check if these are sensible!!)
* ADDED: debugMode preference for the app (for development purposes)
* ADDED: working version of RatingStim

* CHANGED builder handling of keyboard 'allowedKeys' parameter. Instead of `['1','2','q']` you can now simply use `12q` to indicate those three keys. If you want a key like `'right'` and `'left'` you now have to use `$['right','left']`
* TWITTER follow on http://twitter.com/psychopy
* FIXED? win32 version now compatible with Vista/7? Still compatible with XP?

PsychoPy 1.60.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released Feb 2010

* RESTRUCTURED: the serial package is no longer a part of core psychopy and is no longer required (except when hardware is actually being connected). This should now be installed as a dependency by users, but is still included with the Standalone packages.
* RESTRUCTURED: preparing for further devices to be added, hardware is now a folder with files for each manufacturer. Now use e.g.::

    from psychopy.hardware.PR import PR650
    from psychopy.hardware.cedrus import RB730

PsychoPy 1.51.00
------------------------------
(released Nov 2009)

* CHANGED: gamma handling to handle buggy graphics drivers on certain cards - see note below

* ADDED: NxNx3 (ie RGB) numpy arrays can now be used as textures
* FIXED: MovieStim bug on win32 (was giving spurious avbin error if visual was imported before event)

NB. The changes to gamma handling should need no changes to your code, but could alter the gamma correction on
some machines. For setups/studies that require good gamma correction it is recommended that you recalibrate when
you install this version of PsychoPy.

* FIXED visual stimulus positions forced to be floats on init (thanks C Luhmann)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PsychoPy 0.97:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.97.01:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug with IDE not closing properly (when current file was not right-most)
* ADDED parallel.readPin(pinN) so that parallel port can be used for input as well as output
* FIXED bug in parallel.setPortAddress(addr)
* ADDED check for floats as arguments to ElementArrayStim set methods
* CHANGED: frame time recording to be *off* by default (for plotting, for Window.fps() and for warnings). To turn it on use Window.setRecordFrameIntervals(True), preferably after first few frames have elapsed
* IMPROVED detection of the (truly) dropped frames using log.console.setLevel(log.WARNING)
* FIXED bug that was preventing bits++ from detecting LUT on the Mac (ensure screen gamma is 1.0 first)
* FIXED buglet with .setRGB on stimuli - that method should require an operation argument (def=None)
* ADDED fieldDepth and depths (for elements, releative to fieldDepth) as separate arguments to the ElementArrayStim

PsychoP 0.97.00:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED options to DotStim motions. Two args have been added:
  * signalDots can be 'different' from or 'same' as the noise dots (from frame to frame)
  * noiseDots determines the update rule for the distractor dots (random 'position', 'walk', 'direction')
  * dotLife now works (was previously just a placeholder). Default is -1 (so should be same as before)
  see Scase, Braddick & Raymond (1996) for further info on the importance of these
* ADDED options to event.getKeys
  * keyList to limit which keys are checked for (thanks Gary Strangman)
  * timeStamped=False/True/Clock (thanks Dave Britton)
* CHANGED pyglet key checking now returns '1' as the key irrespective of numpad or otherwise (used to return '1' or 'NUM_1')
* FIXED bug in event.py for machines where pyglet is failing to import
* REMOVED AlphaStim (after a long period of 'deprecated')

----------

PsychoPy 0.96:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.96.02:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug introduced with clipping of text in 0.96.01 using textstimuli with shaders  under pygame
* FIXED bug with rendering png alpha layer using pyglet shaders

PsychoPy 0.96.01:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED problem with write errors running demos from Mac IDE
* ADDED frameWidth to textStim for multiline
* ADDED setRecordFrameIntervals, saveFrameTimes() to Window and misc.plotFrameIntervals()
* FIXED had accidentally made pygame a full dependency in visual.py
* FIXED MovieStim was being affected by texture color of other stimuli
* FIXED window now explicitly checks for GL_ARB_texture_float before using shaders

PsychoPy 0.96.00:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED pygame back-end so that can be used as a valid alternative to pyglet (requires pygame1.8+ and PyOpenGL3.0+, both included in mac app)
* CHANGED default sound handler to be pygame again. Although pyglet looked promising for this
  it has turned out to be buggy. Timing of sounds can be very irregular and sometimes they don't even play
  Although pygame has longer overall latencies (20-30ms) it's behaviour is at least robust. This will be
  revisited one day when i have time to write driver-specific code for sounds
* FIXED image importing - scaling from square image wasn't working and CMYK images weren't imported
  properly. Both are now fine.

----------


PsychoPy 0.95:
------------------------------

PsychoPy 0.95.11:

* IDE Cmd-S or Ctrl-S now clears autocomplete

PsychoPy 0.95.7:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED misc.cart2pol()
* ADDED highly optimised ElementArrayStim, suitable for drawing large numbers of elements. Requires fast OpenGL 2.0 gfx card - at least an nVidia 8000 series or ATI HD 2600 are recommended.
* FIXED bug in calibTools with MonitorFolder (should have been monitorFolder)
* FIXED bug in Sound.stop() for pyglet contexts
* FIXED bug in running scripts with spaces in the filename/path (Mac OS X)

PsychoPy 0.95.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* DISABLED the setting of gamma if this is [1,1,1] (allows the user to set it from a control panel and not have this adjusted)
* FIXED gamma setting on linux (thanks to Luca Citi for testing)
* FIXED bug in TextStim.setRGB (wasn't setting properly after text had been created)
* FIXED bug searching for shaders on ATI graphics cards
* FIXED - now no need to download avbin for the mac IDE installation

PsychoPy 0.95.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug in event.clearEvents() implementation in pyglet (wasn't clearing)

    * <Docs and Settings>/<user>/Application Data/PsychoPy
* FIXED bug in text rendering (ATI/win32/pyglet combo only)
* FIXED minor bug in handling of images with alpha channel

PsychoPy 0.95.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED a .clearTextures() method to PatchStim and RadialStim, which should be called before de-referencing a stimulus
* CHANGED input range for numpy array textures to -1:1
* ADDED sysInfo.py to demos

PsychoPy 0.95.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED quitting PsychoPyIDE now correctly cancels when saving files

PsychoPy 0.95.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED problem with saving files from the IDE on Mac
* FIXED Cmd-C now copies from the output window of IDE

Older
----------------------

PsychoPy 0.94.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* pyglet:
  * can use multiple windows and multiple screens (see screensAndWindows demo)
  * sounds are buffered faster and more precisely (16ms with <0.1ms variability on my system)
  * creating sounds in pyglet starts a separate thread. If you use sounds in your script you must call core.quit() when you're done to exit the system (or this background thread will continue).
  * pyglet window.setGamma and setGammaRamp working on win and mac (NOT LINUX)
  * pyglet event.Mouse complete (and supports wheel as well as buttons)
  * pyglet is now the default context. pygame will be used if explicitly called or if pyglet (v1.1+) isn't found
  * pyglet can now get/save movie frames (like pygame)
  * TextStims are much cleaner (and a bit bigger?) Can use multiple lines too. New method for specifying font
* added simpler parallel.py (wraps _parallel which will remain for now)
* removed the C code extensions in favour of ctypes (so compiler no longer necessary)
* converted "is" for "==" where appropriate (thanks Luca)
* Window.getMovieFrame now takes a buffer argument ('front' or 'back')
* monitor calibration files now stored in HOME/.psychopy/monitors rather than site-packages
* Window.flip() added and supports the option not to clear previous buffer (for incremental drawing). Window.update() is still available for now but can be replaced with flip() commands
* updated demos

PsychoPy 0.93.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* bug fixes for OS X 10.5 and ctypes OpenGL
* new improved OS X installer for dependencies
* moved to egg for OS X distribution

PsychoPy 0.93.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added rich text ctrl to IDE output, including links to lines of errors
* IDE now only opens one copy of a given text file
* improved (chances of) sync-to-vertical blank on windows without adjusting driver settings (on windows it's still better to set driver to force sync to be safe!)
* added center and radius arguments to filters.makeMask and filters.makeRadialMatrix
* implemented pyglet backend for;
    * better screen handling (can specify which screen a window should appear in)
    * fewer dependencies (takes care of pygame and opengl)
    * faster sound production
    * TextStims can be multi-line
    * NO GAMMA-SETTING as yet. Don't use this backend if you need a gamma-corrected window and aren't using Bits++.
* changed the behaviour of Window winTypes
    If you leave winType as None PsychoPy tries to use Pygame, Pyglet, GLUT in that order
    (when Pyglet can handle gamma funcs it will become default). Can be overridden by specifying winType.
* turned off depth testing for drawing of text (will simply be overlaid in the order called)
* changes to TextStim: pyglet fonts are loaded by name only, not filename. PsychoPy TextStim now has an additional argument called 'fontFiles=[]' to allow the adding of custom ttf fonts, but the font name should be used as the font=" " argument.
* updated some of the Reference docs

PsychoPy 0.93.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed problem with 'dynamic loading of multitextureARB' (only found on certain graphics cards)

PsychoPy 0.93.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* improved detection of non-OpenGL2.0 drivers

PsychoPy 0.93.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* now automatically uses shaders only if available (older machines can use this version but will not benefit from the speed up)
* slight speed improvement for TextStim rendering (on all machines)

PsychoPy 0.93.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* new requirement of PyOpenGL3.0+ (and a graphics card with OpenGL2.0 drivers?)
* much faster implementation of setRGB, setContrast and setOpacity (using fragment shaders)
* images (and other textures) need not be square. They will be automatically resampled if they arent. Square power-of-two image textures are still recommended
* Fixed problem in calibTools.DACrange caused by change in numpy rounding behaviour. (symptom was strange choice of lum values for calibrations)
* numpy arrays as textures currently need to be NxM intensity arrays
* multitexturing now handled by OpenGL2.0 rather than ARB
* added support for Cedrus response pad
* if any component of rgb*contrast>1 then the stimulus will be drawn as low contrast and b/y (rgb=[0.2,0.2,-0.2]) in an attempt to alert the user that this is out of range

PsychoPy 0.92.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed issue with stairhandler (it was terminating based only on the nTrials). It does now terminate when both the nTrials and the nReversals [or length(stepSizes) if this is greater] are exceeded.
* Minor enhancements to IDE (added explicit handlers to menus for Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Y, Ctrl-D)

PsychoPy 0.92.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed some source packaging problems for linux (removed trademark symbols from serialposix.py and fixed directory capitalisation of IDE/Resources in setup.py). Thanks to Jason Locklin and Samuele Carcagno for picking them up.
* numerous minor improvements to the IDE
* reduced the buffer size of sound stream to reduce latency of sound play
* fixed error installing start menu links (win32)

PsychoPy 0.92.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* new source .zip package (switched away from the use of setuptools - it didn't include files properly in a source dist)
* Fixed problem on very fast computers that meant error messages weren't always displayed in the IDE

PsychoPy 0.92.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* have been trying (and failing) to make scripts run faster from the IDE under Mac OS X. Have tried using threads and debug modules (which would mean you didn't need to import all the libs every time). All these work fine under win32 but not under OS X every time :-( If anyone has a new idea for how to run a pygame window in the same process as the IDE thread I'd love hear it
* removed the messages from the new TextStim stimuli
* fixed bug in IDE that caused it to crash before starting if pythonw.exe was run rather than python.exe on first run(!)
* improvements to the source assistant window (better help and now fetches function arguments)

Known Problems:
* The IDE isn't collecting all errors that are returned - a problem with the process redirection mechanism? FIXED in 0.92.3

PsychoPy 0.92.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed minor bug in IDE - wouldn't open if it had been closed with no open docs.
* fixed problem with pushing/popping matrix that caused the stimuli to disappear (only if a TextStim was rendered repeatedly)

PsychoPy 0.92.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 'sequential' ordering now implemented for data.TrialHandler (thx Ben Webb)
* moved to pygame fonts (with unicode support and any TT font onthe system). The switch will break any code that was using TextStim with lineWidth or letterWidth as args. Users wanting to continue using the previous TextStim can call textStimGLUT instead (although I think the new pygame fonts are superior in every way).
* improved IDE handling of previous size (to cope with being closed in the maximised or minimised state, which previously caused the window not to return)

PsychoPy 0.91.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed minor bug in using numpy.array as a mask (was only working if array was 128x128)
* faster startup for IDE (added threading class for importing modules)
* fixed very minor bug in IDE when searching for attributes that dont exist
* fixed minor bug where scripts with syntax errors didn't run but didn't complain either
* IDE FileOpen now tries the folder that the current file is in first
* IDE removed threading class for running scripts

PsychoPy 0.91.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed the problem of stimulus order/depth. Now the default depth is set (more intuitively) by the order of drawing not creating.
* IDE added recent files to file menu
* IDE minor bug fixes
* IDE rewrite of code inspection using wx.py.instrospect

PsychoPy 0.91.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added find dialog to IDE
* added ability of data.FunctionFromStaircase to create unique bins rather than averaging several x values. Give bins='unique' (rather than bins=someInteger). Also fixed very minor issue where this func would only take a list of lists, rather than a single list.

PsychoPy 0.91.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed IDE problem running filenames containing spaces (only necessary on win32)

PsychoPy 0.91.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added reasonable SourceAssistant to IDE
* added a stop button to abort scripts in IDE
* IDE scripts now run as sub process rather than within the main process: slower but safer
* added an autoflushing stdout to psychopy.__init__. Where lots of text is written to stdout this may be a problem, but turing it off means that stdout doesn't get properly picked up by the IDE :-(

PsychoPy 0.91.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* PsychoPy now has its own IDE!! With syntax-highlighting, code-folding and auto-complete!! :-)
* gui.py had to be refactored a little but (I think) should not be noticed by the end user (gui.Dlg is now a subclass of wx.Dialog rather than a modified instance)
* gui.Dlg and DlgFromDict now end up with an attribute .OK that is either True or False
* fixed bug in data.StairHandler that could result in too many trials being run (since v0.89)

PsychoPy 0.90.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* resolved deprecation warning with wxPython (now using "import wx")

PsychoPy 0.90.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* used the new numpy.mgrid commands throughout filters and visual modules
* sorted out the rounding probs on RadialStim
* fixed import bug in calibtools.py

PsychoPy 0.90.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed new bug in the minVal/maxVal handling of StairHandler (where these have not been specified)
* changed the default console log level to be ERROR, due to too much log output!

PsychoPy 0.90.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed new bug in Sound object
* changed the default log file to go to the script directory rather than site-packages/psychopy

PsychoPy 0.90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* sounds now in stereo and a new function to allow you to choose the settings for the sound system.
* LMS colors (cone-isolating stimuli) are now tested and accurate (when calibrated)
* added logging module (erros, warnings, info). And removed other messages:
     * @Verbose@ flags have become log.info messages
     * @Warn@ commands have become log.warning messages
* added minVal and maxVal arguments to data.StairHandler so that range can be bounded
* @import psychopy@ no longer imports anything other than core

Psychopy 0.89.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed bug in new numpy's handling of bits++ header

Psychopy 0.89
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* optimised DotStim to use vertex arrays (can now draw several thousand dots)
* optimised RadialStim to use vertex arrays (can increase radial resolution without much loss)

Psychopy 0.88
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed problem with MonitorCenter on OSX (buttons not working on recent version of wxPython)

Psychopy 0.87
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added sqrXsqr to RadialStim and made it default texture
* fixed a minor bug in RadialStim rendering (stimuli failed to appear under certain stimulus orderings)
* changed RadialStim size parameter to be diameter rather than radius (to be like AlphaStim)
* namechange: introduced PatchStim (currently identical to AlphaStim which may one day become deprecated)

Psychopy 0.86
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* distributed as an .egg

Psychopy 0.85
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* upgraded for numpy1.0b and scipy0.50. Hopefully those packages are now stable enough that they won't need further PsychoPy compatibility changes

Psychopy 0.84
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW (alpha) support for radial patterns rather than linear ones
* changed Clock behaviour to use time.clock() on win32 rather than time.time()
* fixed a bug in the shuffle seeding behaviour
* added a noise pattern to bacground in monitor calibration

Psychopy 0.83
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW post-install script for Win32 installs shortcuts to your >>Start>Programs menu
* NEW parallel port code (temporary form) using DLportIO.dll can be found under _parallel
* NEW hardware module with support for fORP response box (for MRI) using serial port
* added iterator functionality to data.TrialHandler and data.StairHandler you can now use ::
    for thisTrial in allTrials:

but a consequence was that .nextTrial() will be deprecated in favour of .next().
Also, when the end of the trials is reached a StopIteration is raised.
* added the ability to seed the shuffle mechanism (and trial handler) so you can repeat experiments with the same trial sequence

Psychopy 0.82
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* rewritten code for bits++ LUT drawing, raised by changes in pyOpenGL(2.0.1.09) call to drawpixels
* minor change to exit behaviour. pyGame.quit() is now called and then sys.exit(0) rather than sys.exit(1)
* bug fixes in type handling (from Numeric to numpy)

Psychopy 0.81
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* changes to gui caused by new threading behaviour of wxPython and PyGame (DlgFromDict must now be a class not a function).

Psychopy 0.80
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* switching numeric code to new python24 and new scipy/numpy. MUCH nicer
* new (reduced requirements):
  * numpy 0.9 or newer (the replacement for Numeric/numarray)
  * numpy 0.4.4 or newer
  * pyOpenGL
  * pygame
  * PIL
  * matplotlib (for data plotting)

PsychoPy 0.72
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* tested (and fixed) compatibility with wxPython 2.6. Will now be using this as my primary handler for GUIs
* ADDED ability to quit during run of getLumSeries

PsychoPy 0.71
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED filename bug in makeMovies.makeAnimatedGIF
* slight change to monitors that it uses testMonitor.calib as a default rather than default.calib (testMonitor.calib is packaged with the installation)

PsychoPy 0.70
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED bug in setSize. Wasn't updating correctly
* ADDED ability to append to a data file rather than create new
* bits.lib (from CRS) is now distributed directly with psychopy rather than needing separate install)
* ADDED db/log/linear step methods to StairHandler
* ADDED logistic equation to data.FitFunction

PsychoPy 0.69
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED a testMonitor to the monitors package so that demos can use it for pseudo*calibrated stimuli.
* REDUCED the attempt to use _bits.pyd. Was only necessary for machines that had bits++ monitor center
* ADDED basic staircase method
* CHANGED dlgFromDict to return None on cancel rather than 0
* CHANGED the description of sin textures so that the centre of the patch had the color of dkl or rgb rather
  than the edge. (Effectively all sin textures are now shifted in phase by pi radians).
  -Demos removed from the main package - now ONLY distributed as a separate library

PsychoPy 0.68
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED toFile and fromFile so they work!?
* Demos being distributed as a separate .zip file (may be removed from the main package someday)

PsychoPy 0.67
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED toFile, fromFile, pol2cart functions to psychopy.misc
* CHANGED waitKeys to return a list of keys (usually of length one) so that it's compatible with getKeys

PsychoPy 0.66
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* serial is now a subpackage of psychopy and so doesn't need additional installation
* REMOVED the code to try and query the graphics card about the scr dimensions. From now on, if yo uwish to use real world units, you MUST specify scrWidthPIX and scrWidthCM when you make your visual.Window
* ADDED flag to data output to output matrixOnly (useful for matlab imports)
* REVERTED the default numeric handler to be Numeric rather than numarray (because it looks like numarray hasn't taken off as much as thought)
* FIXED minor bug in text formatting for TrialHandler.saveAsText()
* CHANGED visual.Window so that the monitor argument prefers to receive a Monitor object (rather than just a dictionary) or just the name of one. MonitorCenter makes it so easy to create these now that they should be the default.
* CHANGED Photometer initialisation behaviour - used to raise an error on a fail but now sets an internal attribute .OK to False rather than True

PsychoPy 0.65
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* MonitorCenter now complete. Plots and checks gamma correction.
* can write movies out to animated gifs(any platform) or mpg/avi (both windows only)

PsychoPy 0.64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ChANGED monitor key dkl_rgb_matrix to dkl_rgb (also for lms)
* ADDED code for PR650 to get the monitor color calibration and calculate the color conversion matrices automatically. Will be implemented via the MonitorCenter application.
* ADDED pyserial2.0 as a subpackage of psychopy so that it needn't be separately installed
* Much improved MonitorCenter with DKL and LMS calibration buttons and matrix output
* Double-click installer for Mac now available

PsychoPy 0.63
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED ability to capture frames from the window as images (tif, jpg...) or as animated GIF files :) see demo
* ADDED ability for elements in DotStim to be any arbitrary stimulus with a methods for .setPos(), .draw()

PsychoPy 0.62
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED the circular mask for DotStim
* FIXED bug in the new text alignment method (was being aligned but not positioned?!)

PsychoPy 0.61
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIXED minor bug in MonitorCenter (OS X only)

PsychoPy 0.60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ADDED a GUI application for looking after monitors and calibrations. SEE MonitorCenter.py in the new package monitors
* MOVED "psychopy.calib" subpackage to a whole separate package "monitors". Calibration files will now be stored alongside the calibration code. This makes it easier to develop the new calibration GUI application that I'm working on. Also means that if you delete the psychopy folder for a new installation you won't lose your calibration files.
* ADDED optional maxWait argument to event.waitKeys()
* CHANGED TextStim to take the font as a name rather than font number
* ADDED alignment to text stimuli (alignVert, alignHoriz)
* CHANGED waitKeys to implicitly clear keys from the event queue so that it only finds the first keypress after its called. As result it now returns a single character rather than list of them
* CHANGED visual.Window so that it no longer overrides monitor settings if arguments are specified. Easy now to create a monitor in the monitors GUI and use that instead
* ADDED the circular mask for DotStimulus

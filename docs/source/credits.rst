Developers
---------------

PsychoPy was initially created and maintained by `Jon Peirce`_ but has many contributors to the code:

    **Jeremy Gray**, Yaroslav Halchenko, Erik Kastman, Mike MacAskill, William Hogman, Jonas Lindel√∏v, Ariel Rokem, Dave Britton, Gary Strangman, C Luhmann, Sol Simpson, Hiroyuki Sogo

You can see `details of contributions on Ohloh.net <https://www.ohloh.net/p/PsychoPy/contributors/summary>`_ and there's a visualisation of `PsychoPy's development history <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0xZvHLFrl4>`_ on youtube.

PsychoPy also stands on top of a large number of other developers' work. It wouldn't be possible to write this package without the preceding work of those that wrote the :ref:`dependencies`

Funding
----------------

The PsychoPy project has attracted small grants from the `HEA Psychology Network`_ and `Cambridge Research Systems`_ . Thanks to those organisations for their support.

Jon is paid by `The University of Nottingham`_ (which allows him to spend time on this) and his grants from the `BBSRC`_ and `Wellcome Trust`_ have also helped the development PsychoPy.

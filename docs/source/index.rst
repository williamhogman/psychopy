PsychoPy is an open-source application to allow the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).


News
====================

**Latest version**: 1.75.01 was released Oct 2012. 1.74.00, which was a very major update with lots of new features, especially to the handling of data outputs. Check carefully that this works for you before deploying in your experiments and note that Builder experiments saved from 1.74.xx cannot be opened by older versions. See complete :doc:`changelog`

**Video tutorial**: You can now see a `youtube PsychoPy tutorial <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI>`_ showing you how to build a simple experiment in the Builder interface

P4N: Python for Neuroscience (and Psychology)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
Do you want to get started using Python_ (and PsychoPy_) for your studies in behavioural sciences? Maybe you keep meaning to switch from another package and haven't gotten around to it. This workshop will get you off the ground with building and analysing your experiments using Python.

:When: 25-27 March 2013 (inclusive)
:Where: School of Psychology, University of Nottingham
:Cost: Â£300
:Includes: Refreshments but not lunch. Accommodation is not included but can be booked cheaply via the `University Accommodation Office <http://nottinghamconferences.co.uk/online-bb-bookings/>`_
:Target audience: Novice    
:Content:
    Material will cover *Python* programming basics as well as PsychoPy-specific coding
:Teacher:
    Jon Peirce, creator of *PsychoPy*

*Python* is a powerful well-designed programming language that's totally free and runs on all operating systems. It's a little like a free replacement for Matlab, but with more flexibility and better syntax!

*PsychoPy* is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use software package for conducting studies in psychophysics, neuroimaging and experimental psychology. It's become the package of choice in very many labs worldwide (see `usage statistics <http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php>`_). It comes with a graphical interface (Builder) as well as a Python scripting interface (Coder), which will be the primary focus here.

This course will get you started with:

    - basic *Python* programming (with exercises for non-programmers and for convertees from Matlab)
    - running experiments in *PsychoPy* using code
    - building your own extensions to *PsychoPy*
    - analysing and plotting your data

Registration will be possible soon via the University of Nottingham online store. There will be very limited spaces available (probably 30) in order that participants get the most out of the event. The workshop will include a mixture of demonstrations, self-paced exercises and periods of users creating their own experiment in the software. 

Details of the workshop are certainly subject to change at this stage.

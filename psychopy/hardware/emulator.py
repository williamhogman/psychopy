    """
    Accepts up to four fMRI scan parameters (TR, volumes, sync-key, skip), and
    launches an experiment in one of two modes: Scan, or Test.
    
    :Usage:
        See Coder Demo -> experiment control -> fMRI_launchScan.py.
        
        In brief: 1) from psychopy.hardware.emulator import launchScan;
        2) Define your args; and 3) add 'vol = launchScan(args)'
        at the top of your experiment script.
    
    launchScan() waits for the first sync pulse and then returns, allowing your
    experiment script to proceed. The key feature is that, in test mode, it first
    starts an autonymous thread that emulates sync pulses (i.e., CPU-emulated rather
    than MR-generated). The thread places a character in the key buffer, exactly like
    a keyboard event does. launchScan will wait for the first such sync pulse (i.e.,
    character in the key buffer). launchScan returns the number of sync pulses
    detected so far (i.e., 1), so that a script can account for them explicitly.
    
    If a globalClock is given (highly recommended), it is reset to 0.0 when the
    first sync pulse is detected. If a mode was not specified when calling
    launchScan, the operator is prompted to select Scan or Test (via a
    :class:`~psychopy.visual.RatingScale`). 
    
    If **scan mode** is selected, the script will wait until the first scan pulse
    is detected. Typically this would be coming from the scanner, but note that
    it could also be a person manually pressing that key.
    
    If **test mode** is selected, launchScan() starts a separate thread to emit
    sync pulses / key presses. Note that this thread is effectively nothing more than
    a key-pressing metronome, emitting a key at the start of every TR, doing so with
    high temporal precision. (This thread is an instance of a :class:`~psychopy.hardware.emulator.SyncGenerator`,
    with code separate from launchScan. The class
    provides a generic key-metronome thread, and is not specific to fMRI in any way.)
    
    In test mode, user responses can also be emulated in a similar fashion. If
    simResponses is a list of tuples [(time, key), (time, key), ...], each key is
    virtually "pressed" at the specified time. (This is also implemented as a
    thread, an instance of a :class:`~psychopy.hardware.emulator.ResponseEmulator`, again generic
    and not fMRI-specific.)
    
    If your MR hardware interface does not deliver a key character as a sync flag,
    you can still use launchScan() to test script timing. You have to code
    your experiment to trigger on either a sync character (to test timing) or
    your usual sync flag (for actual scanning).

        win: a :class:`~psychopy.visual.Window` object (required)

            TR :
                seconds per whole-brain volume (minimum value = 0.1s)
            volumes :
                number of whole-brain (3D) volumes to obtain in a given scanning run.

                (optional) key for sync timing, default = '5'.
            skip :
                (optional) how many volumes to silently omit initially (during T1 
                stabilization, no sync pulse). default = 0.
                     
        globalClock :
            optional but highly recommended :class:`~psychopy.core.Clock` to
            be used during the scan; if one is given, it is reset to 0.000 when
            the first sync pulse is received.
            
        simResponses :
            optional list of tuples [(time, key), (time, key), ...]. time values 
            are seconds after the first scan pulse is received.  
        
        esc_key :
            key to be used for user-interrupt during launch. default = 'escape'
        
        mode :
            if mode is 'Test' or 'Scan', launchScan() will start in that mode.
        
        instr :
            instructions to be displayed to the scan operator during mode selection.
        
        wait_msg :
            message to be displayed to the subject while waiting for the scan to 
            start (i.e., after operator indicates start but before the first
            scan pulse is received).
            
        wait_timeout :
            time in seconds that launchScan will wait before assuming something went
            wrong and exiting. Defaults to 300sec (5 minutes). Raises a TimeoutError
            if no sync pulse is received in the allowable time.
